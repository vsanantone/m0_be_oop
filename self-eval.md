# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
This was difficult, but not impossible. I have not finished, yet I am still going towards the prize.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
It is fine, but I need how to not be discouraged when I don't meet deadlines. That is my biggest issue right now.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? Ask for help, be quick to ask, and slow to listen.
